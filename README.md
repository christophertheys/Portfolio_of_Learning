Developing a portfolio of learning that shows my competency development and understanding of Health Analytics ðŸ©º

Personal Statement and Reflection

Harnessing the power of numbers as a Chartered Accountant (ACCA), my personal goals are aimed at unlocking the mysteries wrapped in data through the lens of data science and machine learning. With my core strengths in accounting, finance, and mathematics, coupled with an interest in coding, my adventure into the world of data science, has been both enlightening and transformative.

My affinity for integrating software, data, and analytics has evolved into a particular interest in data science and machine learning principles. Through the course of the Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science, exploring health analytics emerged as a new field, expanding my academic and professional horizons. Prior to my academic endeavors in data science, my insight into health analytics was notably sparse, confined to a minimal understanding of public healthcare in South Africa. 
This limited perception was accumulated predominantly through family connections, with relatives serving in pivotal roles as Director Generals in the public healthcare sector. Consequently, my knowledge was rooted more in administrative and policy-oriented aspects, rather than the analytical and data-driven dimensions now being explored through my current studies.

By delving deeper into basic concepts of health analytics, I explored and understood the complexities of supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Supervised learning, in which algorithms are trained using labeled data, and unsupervised learning, in which algorithms explore unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns. These concepts have paved the way for valuable insights, including predicting and understanding patient outcomes, optimizing operational efficiency, and uncovering risk potential elements within health datasets.
