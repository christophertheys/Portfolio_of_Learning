Personal Statement and Reflection

Harnessing the power of numbers as a Chartered Accountant (ACCA), my personal goals are aimed at unlocking the mysteries wrapped in data through the lens of data science and machine learning. With my core strengths in accounting, finance, and mathematics, coupled with an interest in coding, my adventure into the world of data science, has been both enlightening and transformative.

My affinity for integrating software, data, and analytics has evolved into a particular interest in data science and machine learning principles. Through the course of the Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science, exploring health analytics emerged as a new field, expanding my academic and professional horizons. Prior to my academic endeavors in data science, my insight into health analytics was notably sparse, confined to a minimal understanding of public healthcare in South Africa. 
This limited perception was accumulated predominantly through family connections, with relatives serving in pivotal roles as Director Generals in the public healthcare sector. Consequently, my knowledge was rooted more in administrative and policy-oriented aspects, rather than the analytical and data-driven dimensions now being explored through my current studies.

By delving deeper into basic concepts of health analytics, I explored and understood the complexities of supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Supervised learning, in which algorithms are trained using labeled data, and unsupervised learning, in which algorithms explore unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns. These concepts have paved the way for valuable insights, including predicting and understanding patient outcomes, optimizing operational efficiency, and uncovering risk potential elements within health datasets.

## Defining Health Analytics

Defining Health Analytics

Embarking on a deep dive into the realm of health analytics through my Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science, my understanding of this field has been holistically shaped by a series of assignments that intertwined the theoretical knowledge with hands-on application. 

Initially, defining the foundational building blocks of a Health System through visual representation on a Miro Board, followed by crafting an essay to explore Contemporary Health Systems Challenges, set the initial stage of understanding the current healthcare setting and its inherent complexities. This was effectively contrasted with practical tasks, such as employing Python libraries like pandas and numpy to dissect datasets and leveraging Matplotlib for data visualization, which not only amplified my technical skillset but also enabled me to draw tangible correlations between data and healthcare quality improvement. 



The courses also helped me understand the important role of data science in health systems science, through identifying and establishing the necessary skills of a health analyst, whilst concurrently illuminating my growth areas through practical application. 

Leveraging different tools and technologies, such as cloud computing and markup, I deciphered the dominant technology groups in data analytics and contextualized the current state of data analytics in the medical field. As I navigate the various types of medical data sources and meticulously analyzed electronic health records, I learnt to place a significant emphasis on evaluating, preparing, and managing data quality, including developing strategic methods to eliminate null values and prepares data for multifaceted analyses.

My journey also delved into the technicalities of managing dataset dimensions, where I applied Principal Component Analyses (PCA) and clustering algorithms such as K-means to principal components from datasets, consequently enhancing my practical understanding of both supervised and unsupervised learning methodologies. 

The program naturally evolved to address critical aspects like data security, ensuring that my insights into health analytics are not only rooted in optimizing data utility but also safeguarding sensitive information, thereby synthesizing technical know-how with ethical practice. Consequently, this multifaceted approach has scaffolded my transition from a nascent understanding of health analytics to developing a robust, hands-on expertise that cohesively intertwines technical proficiency with a comprehensive understanding of healthcare systems and challenges.
