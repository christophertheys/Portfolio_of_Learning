Leveraging different tools and technologies, such as cloud computing and markup, I deciphered the dominant technology groups in data analytics and contextualized the current state of data analytics in the medical field. As I navigate the various types of medical data sources and meticulously analyzed electronic health records, I learnt to place a significant emphasis on evaluating, preparing, and managing data quality, including developing strategic methods to eliminate null values and prepares data for multifaceted analyses.

My journey also delved into the technicalities of managing dataset dimensions, where I applied Principal Component Analyses (PCA) and clustering algorithms such as K-means to principal components from datasets, consequently enhancing my practical understanding of both supervised and unsupervised learning methodologies. 

The program naturally evolved to address critical aspects like data security, ensuring that my insights into health analytics are not only rooted in optimizing data utility but also safeguarding sensitive information, thereby synthesizing technical know-how with ethical practice. Consequently, this multifaceted approach has scaffolded my transition from a nascent understanding of health analytics to developing a robust, hands-on expertise that cohesively intertwines technical proficiency with a comprehensive understanding of healthcare systems and challenges.

Lab 1 Reflection - 
Embarking upon an assignment that melded theoretical knowledge with applied skills, for this group task we delved deeply into the nuances of linear regression modelling, utilizing a carefully selected dataset as the bedrock for our exploration. 

The initial phase demanded meticulous analysis of the dataset, wherein we dedicated substantial efforts towards understanding its features, distribution, and potential predictors. Upon selecting a relevant dataset, the journey ventured into practical implementation, utilizing Python libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn to materialize a linear regression model. Here, we were able to put theory into practice, initializing the model, fitting it with data, and ultimately observing the resultant predictions and residuals. 

This practical aspect not only solidified my understanding of the algorithmâ€™s workings but also provided invaluable hands-on experience with coding and model implementation. Furthermore, throughout the implementation, each decision-making junctureâ€”from selecting independent and dependent variables, pre-processing data, to tuning the modelâ€”was anchored by thorough justification and clear delineation of the process followed. This required weaving theoretical knowledge of linear regression, gleaned from course materials, with the practical challenges and considerations encountered during implementation.

## Types of Data 

Types of Data Reflection â€“ Exploring Data

Disease Classification - Algorithms can be trained to classify diseases like tumours as malignant or benign. This uses categorical data as the outcome is typically a distinct category.

Prediction of Patient Readmission Rates - Hospitals might use patient data to predict the likelihood of a patient being readmitted within a certain time frame. This would be categorical data. 

Blood Sugar Level - Machine learning models can predict future blood sugar levels. This problem leverages continuous data as blood sugar levels are measured on a continuous scale. 

Estimation of Drug Response - Analysing patient genetics and other biomarkers, machine learning models can be designed to predict how a patient will respond to a particular medication. This would be classified as categorical data as either a positive response, neutral response, or a negative response. 

Progression Tracking of Neurological Diseases â€“ Diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, machine learning models can be utilised to analyse patient data and predict the rate of disease progression. This uses continuous data, because the disease progression will be measured on a continuous basis.
